# NPV Calculator

This project is a net present value (NPV) calculator.  NPV is used to determine the present value of future cash flows and to estimate the profitability of an investment.  If the NPV is positive that could mean that a project is worth taking and can be compared to other projects.  Alternatively, if the NPV is negative, the project will not be profitable and should not be pursued.  Potential issues with using NPV include uncertainty with future cash flow estimates.  

Features Include:
- 

The user may input anywhere between two and ten periods.  User inputs include the required rate of return and future value of cash flows for each period.  Users can create an account and save calculations.  This project was created primarily using Django REST Framework, React, Redux, Docker, and Webpack.  For this project, token authentication is used and tokens are saved as cookies.
